To fight back against these policies, an international network of over 90 digital rights organizations, businesses, journalists and Internet users from 30 countries have convened under the banner of “SaveTheLink” to catalogue and push back against sustained threats to the link.

There are at least 90 African tech hubs that serve as infrastructure to catalyze technology, entrepreneurship, and innovation. Not only do they act as physical infrastructure, providing access to power, internet, and space, but they also offer access to human, financial and social capital. By distributing these resources more efficiently, hubs make it easier to build start-ups, develop tech, and foster innovation.\nBut can hubs also create better solutions to complex social problems? Many tech hubs are engaged in developing tech solutions for education, health, and governance challenges. However, there is an opportunity to push past “there's an app for that” thinking and reconceive tech hubs as creative spaces that foster tech-enabled, innovative problem solving.",

It explores how mapping, quantification, visualization and other digital techniques can be used in those subjects, and brings a humanities perspective on current issues in the digital world such as identity, intellectual property and globalization.\n\nHow does the digital humanities work with the artists, makers, performers, coders and wranglers at events like Mozilla Festival? How do we build better connections between the world of digital makers and that of historians and literary critics? These issues will be discussed by Jon Rogers of Dundee University with two leading commentators on the digital humanities, Tobias Blanke of King’s College London and Andrew Prescott of Glasgow University, AHRC Fellow for the ‘Digital Transformations’ theme.",

High school students across the US began tweeting #HandsUpWalkOut--they were planning a national student walkout to protest police violence against people of color. This wasn’t organized by a formal organization, just high school kids on social media. That night I made the first version of “Day of Action” and put it on HandsUpWalkOut.com. Over the next two days,  student organizers used the app to coordinate 100+ walkouts & related actions.

Come armed with a laptop and a good way to take notes, we’ll provide the software and video samples from the 2016 US elections.\n\nWe will start by working with tools for accessing TV and closed captions. Then we will learn how to manipulate, clean, categorize, and extract information from the collected content. Finally we will explore how to use this information.\n\nThe format will be workshop-style (small groups of 3-5 people in each group), with the tools and recommended experiments provided by the facilitators for each of the three pipeline phases we will be targeting.\n\nTo show you a working larger system using most all the tools in this toolkit, we'll go over the TV News Political Ads project at Internet Archive.\n\nWe will break folks into 3-5 person groups (targeting groups of 5) which will make it easy to replicate across any number of participants.\n\nOutcomes:\n\n* Participants will walk away understanding how to use cutting edge tools and techniques for collecting, manipulating, presenting, and working with video.\n",

Together with educators and program designers from Game Changer Chicago Design Lab at The University of Chicago and Chicago Academy of Sciences/Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum, session participants will explore, create and share game-based tools for education.

Have a fruitful discussion about the topic \"Anonymity in online news communities\" and 2. create something together! This could be a toolkit for community managers or a listicle of the most important points with regard to our issue. The storytelling project [\"Are we up for Anonymity?](http://berlinergazette.de/are-we-up-for-anonymity) that Francis and I created together with a group of journalists, coders and community managers in a 2-day-journathon will serve as an inspiration for our session.\n",

In this session, learn to create and publish your own animated video from scratch. We will also explore Adobe Expressions, a javascript like language, for coding your animation behaviors in a video.\nThis session is good for beginners new to making videos as well as for people with some experience in video production looking to add animation to your skill set.\n*Prerequisites:*  A working installation of Adobe After Effects and Adobe Photoshop. You can get a free 30-day trial from Adobe Creative Cloud at http://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/desktop-app.html.

How can we use the web to make the existing information more accessible?

It will point to some open data sources (especially related to environmental monitoring) and offer an open dialogue in order to transform the current scientific processes using web technologies.

My journal is the catalyst for change.  Here, I curate ideas, record my learning, reflect on the process, and celebrate success and failures.\nLearn: Disrupting the status-quo often brings chaos.

You’ve heard about projects people have made with one, but have no idea where to start? Well this workshop is for you!   \nAimed at young (or simply young at heart) beginners, you will be shown how to get started with a Raspberry Pi using Scratch!    \nFirst you will be introduced to the Pi itself and understand all the things you need to get any computer working. Next, you’ll find out about the mysterious GPIO pins and how they can be used with LEDs, buttons, buzzers, speakers and various electronic add-ons. Finally, using block-based coding language Scratch, we will show you how to use a Raspberry Pi to code a set of traffic lights with a motion sensor and from there, your only limit is your imagination.   \n   \nThis workshops is part of the YouthZone Raspberry Pi workshops series.

The workshop will use a physical timeline created from paper were people will use sticky notes to add there memories to the extensive timeline. There will also be a memory vault for all those secret memories and confessions that you don't want to have your name on.\n\nWe hope that the people participating in our workshop can be a part of a larger and more connected world through the sharing of their memories. By doing this we hope we can expand our knowledge on a world revolutionised by technology and the educational effect it had on people. After mozfest we hope to expand this idea through an app or website which could collate information from around the world and allow users to view and add to a century of technological memories in one place.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @mozfesttimeline and add your memories to the timeline from wherever you are in the world.",
