There are at least 90 African tech hubs that serve as infrastructure to catalyze technology, entrepreneurship, and innovation. Not only do they act as physical infrastructure, providing access to power, internet, and space, but they also offer access to human, financial and social capital. By distributing these resources more efficiently, hubs make it easier to build start-ups, develop tech, and foster innovation.\nBut can hubs also create better solutions to complex social problems? Many tech hubs are engaged in developing tech solutions for education, health, and governance challenges. However, there is an opportunity to push past “there's an app for that” thinking and reconceive tech hubs as creative spaces that foster tech-enabled, innovative problem solving.",

The workshop will use a physical timeline created from paper were people will use sticky notes to add there memories to the extensive timeline. There will also be a memory vault for all those secret memories and confessions that you don't want to have your name on.\n\nWe hope that the people participating in our workshop can be a part of a larger and more connected world through the sharing of their memories. By doing this we hope we can expand our knowledge on a world revolutionised by technology and the educational effect it had on people. After mozfest we hope to expand this idea through an app or website which could collate information from around the world and allow users to view and add to a century of technological memories in one place.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @mozfesttimeline and add your memories to the timeline from wherever you are in the world.",

High school students across the US began tweeting #HandsUpWalkOut--they were planning a national student walkout to protest police violence against people of color. This wasn’t organized by a formal organization, just high school kids on social media. That night I made the first version of “Day of Action” and put it on HandsUpWalkOut.com. Over the next two days,  student organizers used the app to coordinate 100+ walkouts & related actions. The tool provides a workflow for adding a local event and generates a map so others can find local actions. Thousands of people participated and the tool was used 100k times that weekend.",

Come armed with a laptop and a good way to take notes, we’ll provide the software and video samples from the 2016 US elections.\n\nWe will start by working with tools for accessing TV and closed captions. Then we will learn how to manipulate, clean, categorize, and extract information from the collected content. Finally we will explore how to use this information.\n\nThe format will be workshop-style (small groups of 3-5 people in each group), with the tools and recommended experiments provided by the facilitators for each of the three pipeline phases we will be targeting.\n\nTo show you a working larger system using most all the tools in this toolkit, we'll go over the TV News Political Ads project at Internet Archive.\n\nWe will break folks into 3-5 person groups (targeting groups of 5) which will make it easy to replicate across any number of participants.\n\nOutcomes:\n\n* Participants will walk away understanding how to use cutting edge tools and techniques for collecting, manipulating, presenting, and working with video.\n",

By the time we're done, we'll have descriptions of one or more possible evolutions of podcasting.

Have a fruitful discussion about the topic \"Anonymity in online news communities\" and 2. create something together! This could be a toolkit for community managers or a listicle of the most important points with regard to our issue. The storytelling project [\"Are we up for Anonymity?](http://berlinergazette.de/are-we-up-for-anonymity) that Francis and I created together with a group of journalists, coders and community managers in a 2-day-journathon will serve as an inspiration for our session.\n",

We will also explore Adobe Expressions, a javascript like language, for coding your animation behaviors in a video.\nThis session is good for beginners new to making videos as well as for people with some experience in video production looking to add animation to your skill set.\n*Prerequisites:*  A working installation of Adobe After Effects and Adobe Photoshop. You can get a free 30-day trial from Adobe Creative Cloud at http://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/desktop-app.html.

They have accepted that apps and platforms can deliver content faster than their own bloated invasive websites. They forget the core purpose of the Web was to efficiently deliver text and media to a networked readership.\n\nAnd who could blame them?\n\nConsider an article of 40KB in text takes 2.5MB to deliver with auto-play ads, and 15s to load on a broadband connection on a publisher website. Imagine Facebook Instant Articles, Pocket, Apple News, or Flipboard and the inverse experience.\n\nTo preserve the publisher web site as something of relevance and within the control of publishers we need to rethink everything from content, ads, paywalls, and experience.\n\nThe goal is to determine whether to relinquish control and syndicate our content and continue a meaningful relationship with our audience.\n\n### Agenda\nIdentify the problems in the system: Often we are our own worst enemies as an organization.

Nominally the topic is about the science of space, and the moon. However we will use this subject to explore collaboration, science and federated learning.\nParticipants will:\n1) Learn to set up and install software on a Raspberry Pi\n2) Learn to set up and install a NodeJS server running Fedwiki\n3) Learn how to share data and media with other spaces using a serverless architecture based on decentralised technologies such as IPFS\nFinally we will have a lot of fun, exploring the moon.",

My journal is the catalyst for change.  Here, I curate ideas, record my learning, reflect on the process, and celebrate success and failures.\nLearn: Disrupting the status-quo often brings chaos.

I learned to code by modifying and hosting an MMORPG private server, where I was able to change the gamerules using code. This allowed me to be creative; I was able to express myself through changing the game world and rules. For me, and many others, the desire to mod games is very strong, and for the first time, it is very accessible.

You’ve heard about projects people have made with one, but have no idea where to start? Well this workshop is for you!   \nAimed at young (or simply young at heart) beginners, you will be shown how to get started with a Raspberry Pi using Scratch!    \nFirst you will be introduced to the Pi itself and understand all the things you need to get any computer working. Next, you’ll find out about the mysterious GPIO pins and how they can be used with LEDs, buttons, buzzers, speakers and various electronic add-ons. Finally, using block-based coding language Scratch, we will show you how to use a Raspberry Pi to code a set of traffic lights with a motion sensor and from there, your only limit is your imagination.   \n   \nThis workshops is part of the YouthZone Raspberry Pi workshops series.

The workshop will use a physical timeline created from paper were people will use sticky notes to add there memories to the extensive timeline. There will also be a memory vault for all those secret memories and confessions that you don't want to have your name on.\n\nWe hope that the people participating in our workshop can be a part of a larger and more connected world through the sharing of their memories. By doing this we hope we can expand our knowledge on a world revolutionised by technology and the educational effect it had on people. After mozfest we hope to expand this idea through an app or website which could collate information from around the world and allow users to view and add to a century of technological memories in one place.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @mozfesttimeline and add your memories to the timeline from wherever you are in the world.",
